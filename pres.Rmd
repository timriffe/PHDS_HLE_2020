\Large
> Average number of years lived in good health

\pause

> Summary index of an underlying distribution

## Motivation

- Quality vs quantity of years?
- Hidden inequality?
- Process?
- Labor force (GALI question)?
- Advocacy?

## Monitoring

## Campell's Law

> “The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor”

## Goodhart's Law

> “Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.”

## Anything to discuss?

## Measures

- Sullivan
- Multistate

## Sullivan 

- $HLE(x) = \int l(x)\pi(x) \mathrm{d}x$
- List properties (5 min)

## Multistate

- Process model
- Draw state space diagrams 
- Draw how it works 

## Properties

## Variants

- Discrete
  - Matrix algebra *
  - Lifetable *
  - Simulation *
- Continuous
  - Matrix algebra
  - Differential equations
  
## Considerations

- Initial conditions?
- Mid-interval approximations?
- Strata or state?
- Memoryless?
- Rate fluctuations?
- Health comparability?
  
## Equivalencies

- Cohorts
- Stationary populations
  - reversibility
  
## Further training

- early December Jutta Gampe Multistate course.
- maaaybe Spring Hal Caswell matrix pop course. 

## Special conferences

- IAPHS <https://iaphs.org/>
- REVES <https://reves.site.ined.fr/en/home/about_reves/>

## Local technical resources

- Transition probs: J. Gampe, A. Carollo, D. Schneider, A. Lorenti, C. Dudel
- Markov measures: C. Dudel, me

## Stuff I work on

- Within-inequality in Sullivan setting
- Decomposition of discrete multistate
- Other within-lifecourse duration measures
- Time perspectives on compression and ageing
